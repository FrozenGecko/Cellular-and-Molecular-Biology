## Cell Membrane
The cell membrane acts as a selective barrier. The cell is separated from its surrounding via the plasma membrane. This enables the cell's inside to be different from that of the surrounding enviroment.
 
The plasma membrane is used for cell communication, transport of molecules, and cell groth and motility.  

`reciving information: Receptor proteins in the plasma membrane enable the cell to receive
signals from the environment`
`import and export of small molecules. Transport proteins in the membrane enable the import and export of small molecules`
`capacity for movement and expansion. The flexibility of the membrane and its capacity for expansion allow the cell to grow, change shape, and move.`

### The Lipid Bilayer.
The fundimental structure of the cell membrane is the lipid bilayer. It consist of a hydrophilic head and  hydrophobic tail(s).

## Essential Concepts
##### These are straight from the textbook.

>Cell membranes enable cells to create barriers that confine particular molecules to specific compartments. They consist of a continuous double layer—a bilayer—of lipid molecules in which proteins are embedded.

>The lipid bilayer provides the basic structure and barrier function of all cell membranes.

>Membrane lipid molecules are amphipathic, having both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic regions. This property promotes their spontaneous assembly into bilayers when placed in water, forming closed compartments that reseal if torn.

>There are three major classes of membrane lipid molecules: phospholipids, sterols, and glycolipids.

>The lipid bilayer is fluid, and individual lipid molecules are able to diffuse within their own monolayer; they do not, however, spontaneously flip from one monolayer to the other.

>The two lipid monolayers of a cell membrane have different lipid compositions, reflecting the different functions of the two faces of the membrane.

>Cells that live at different temperatures maintain their membrane fluidity by modifying the lipid composition of their membranes.

>Membrane proteins are responsible for most of the functions of cell membranes, including the transport of small, water-soluble molecules across the lipid bilayer.

>Transmembrane proteins extend across the lipid bilayer, usually as one or more α helices but sometimes as a β sheet rolled into the form of a barrel.

>Other membrane proteins do not extend across the lipid bilayer but are attached to one or the other side of the membrane, either by noncovalent association with other membrane proteins, by covalent attachment of lipids, or by association of an exposed amphipathic α helix with a single lipid monolayer.

>Most cell membranes are supported by an attached framework of proteins. An especially important example is the meshwork of fibrous proteins that forms the cell cortex underneath the plasma membrane.

>Although many membrane proteins can diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane, cells have ways of confining proteins to specific membrane domains. They can also immobilize particular membrane proteins by attaching them to intracellular or extracellular macromolecules.

>Many of the proteins and some of the lipids exposed on the surface of cells have attached sugar chains, which form a carbohydrate layer that helps protect and lubricate the cell surface, while also being involved in specific cell–cell recognition.
